# Virtual Reality + Swift 
This is a port of [Google's Cardboard SDK](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) to Swift and iOS. It is inspired by a [Java decompilation](https://github.com/rsanchezsaez/cardboard-java) and [C++ port](https://github.com/rsanchezsaez/CardboardSDK-iOS) by [Ricardo Sánchez-Sáez](https://github.com/rsanchezsaez).

##Notes
### Build

Download / clone the repo, open in Xcode, and click build and run. Easy!

### Info & Warnings

This was tested and works reasonably well on an iPhone 6+. 

The entire project was written in 1 day, and a programmer's best friend -- copy/paste -- was heavily involved. There are sure to be bugs. 

### "... this looks like a C++ programmer writing Swift..."

Indeed! This was written primarily an exercise to learn Swift. I'd love to learn how to make it more idiomatic (Swift-y? Swift-onic? Swift-arific?) either via pull-requests or direct email.


## Why and what's the point?

From [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!):

*He says, "Feynman, that's pretty interesting, but what's the importance of it? Why are you doing it?"*

*"Hah!" I say. "There's no importance whatsoever. I'm just doing it for the fun of it." His reaction didn't discourage me; I had made up my mind I was going to enjoy physics and do whatever I liked.*

*I went on to work out equations of wobbles. Then I thought about how electron orbits start to move in relativity. Then there's the Dirac Equation in electrodynamics. And then quantum electrodynamics. And before I knew it (it was a very short time) I was "playing" - working, really - with the same old problem that I loved so much, that I had stopped working on when I went to Los Alamos: my thesis-type problems; all those old-fashioned, wonderful things.*

*It was effortless. It was easy to play with these things. It was like uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly. I almost tried to resist it! There was no importance to what I was doing, but ultimately there was. The diagrams and the whole business that I got the Nobel Prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.*
